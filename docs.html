  <h2>Front-End Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)</h2>
  <p>
    The intern may be exposed to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while enhancing general coding knowledge.
    Initially, the intern may develop a single wireframe-based front-end suitable for customer testing.
    This process may be iterative, requiring multiple edits and refinements before deployment as a live page.
    This introductory project is intended to support gradual skill development and foundational understanding
    of front-end workflows.
